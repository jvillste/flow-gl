Event handling
-------------
When awt event occurs, it is added to an event queue (persistent queue in a ref).

Application loop
- if the event queue is empty and no animations are running block
  until the event queue contains something
- update application state based on events from the event queue
- update application state based on elapsed time
- offer the render loop the new application state to be rendered using a SynchronousQueue
- wait for the next frame to achieve the requested frames per second

Render loop
- wait for a new application state to be rendered using a SynchronousQueue
- update gpu state based on the application state
- render


Aspects
--------------
GPU update
Event handling
View state
Layout

Tooling
-------------
Inspect element
- Shows view part path and code
- Shows drawables

Pitäisi pystyä tekemään jotain muuta kuin mitä nykyisillä tekniikoilla voi helposti tehdä
kuvan linkittäminen koodiin, mikä funktio tuotti tämän osan kuvasta

Handling focus

? How to move focus?
? What are the concepts?
  ! Layout
  ! Keyboard event handler
  ! Mouse event handler
? How to trigger actions for button presses
  ? How do these actions read the model
  ? How do these actions change the model
? How to change model with asynchronous calls
? How to make disabled widgets unable to get focus
? How to enable dynamic view hierarchy

model -> view-state
view-state -> view


model -> view-state
         view-state -> view

model -> view-state
         view

child-view-state -> view-state
                    focus-handlers

(p View is a function 
   ( state state-path ) ->  ( visual state )
of a view state to a visual and a new view
state. The view state affects the child view states, which are updated
during the view function execution.)

(p View function parameters are the view state, focus path...)


Middleware

state -> layout
event, state, layout -> state



Change detection

Layout
Layoutable
Drawable
Renderer
- Renders drawables
Render tree
- Layouted drawables and transformer nodes. This is reduced to a list of
  drawables by applying the transformers in the depth first order.
Render tree transformer
- A function from drawables to drawables
Render tree transformer node
- A node without a drawable, just transformers to be applied to the tree below



TODO
-----

- run transformers after layout
-- run transformers in view calls

- partial updating of render targets / frame buffer objects

- tiled rendering where each tile is a render target

- mouse enter and leave events should not propagate to parents that are unaffected by the mouse movement

OK - scroll bars to scroll view
OK -- make size dependent work again

- make scroll view clip the scrolled area

- how to force view refres after mouse event handler with side effects ala tracing a function in tools.trace

- set initial focus after the view calls are resolved the first time

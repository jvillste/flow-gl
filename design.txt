Event handling
-------------
When awt event occurs, it is added to an event queue (persistent queue in a ref).

Application loop
- if the event queue is empty and no animations are running block
  until the event queue contains something
- update application state based on events from the event queue
- update application state based on elapsed time
- offer the render loop the new application state to be rendered using a SynchronousQueue
- wait for the next frame to achieve the requested frames per second

Render loop
- wait for a new application state to be rendered using a SynchronousQueue
- update gpu state based on the application state
- render
